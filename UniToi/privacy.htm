			<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
			<p>- Updated May, 2021<br><br>

				This following document sets forth the Privacy Policy for the UniToi website, http://www.unitoi.com.<br><br>
				
				UniToi is committed to providing you with the best possible customer service experience. UniToi is bound by 
				the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth), which sets out a number of principles concerning the privacy of individuals.
			</p>
			<br>
			<h2>Collection of your Personal Information</h2>
			<p>
				There are many aspects of the site which can be viewed without providing personal information, however, for access to 
				future UniToi customer support features you are required to submit personally identifiable information. This may 
				include but not limited to a unique username and password, or provide sensitive information in the recovery of your 
				lost password.
			</p>
			<br>
			<h2>Sharing of your Personal Information</h2>
			<p>
				We may occasionally hire other companies to provide services on our behalf, including but not limited to handling customer 
				support enquiries, processing transactions or customer freight shipping. Those companies will be permitted to obtain only 
				the personal information they need to deliver the service. UniToi takes reasonable steps to ensure that these organisations 
				are bound by confidentiality and privacy obligations in relation to the protection of your personal information.
			</p>
			<br>
			<h2>Use of your Personal Information</h2>
			<p>
				For each visitor to reach the site, we expressively collect the following non-personally identifiable information, including
				but not limited to browser type, version and language, operating system, pages viewed while browsing the Site, page access 
				times and referring website address. This collected information is used solely internally for the purpose of gauging visitor 
				traffic, trends and delivering personalized content to you while you are at this Site.
			</p>
			<p>
				From time to time, we may use customer information for new, unanticipated uses not previously disclosed in our privacy notice. 
				If our information practices change at some time in the future we will use for these new purposes only, data collected from the 
				time of the policy change forward will adhere to our updated practices.
			</p>
			<br>
			<h2>Changes to this Privacy Policy</h2>
			<p>
				UniToi reserves the right to make amendments to this Privacy Policy at any time. If you have objections to the Privacy Policy, 
				you should not access or use the Site.
			</p>
			<br>
			<h2>Accessing Your Personal Information</h2>
			<p>
				You have a right to access your personal information, subject to exceptions allowed by law. If you would like to do so, please 
				let us know. You may be required to put your request in writing for security reasons. UniToi reserves the right to charge a fee 
				for searching for, and providing access to, your information on a per request basis.
			</p>
