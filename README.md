This is a High-Fidelity Prototype of UniToi, a toilet finder website for The University of Sydney. UniToi is a web application that helps USYD students, staffs, and visitors to locate toilets around the campus area. Users can search for toilets based on its location, facilities, ratings, reviews, etc. Users can also write reviews and report faulty toilets to the facility management.

This prototype is limited to only a Front-End design with a "dummy" backend. All informations provided are only for demonstration purposes.
